# Fake Fashion website project

Made it to test the [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) plugin and to create a smooth scrolling experience.
It's a simple two-page website without any fancy stuff. You can check it [here](https://festive-bassi-1ca8ec.netlify.app/).
